Pieces of Learning a Language

Syntax:
  How to you write language constructs?

Semantics:
  What do programs mean? (Evaluation rules)

Idioms:
  What are typical patterns for using language features to express you computation?

Libraries:
  What facilities does the language (or a well-known project) provide "standard"? (E.g., file accessm data structures)

Tools:
  What do language implementations provide to make your job easier? (E.g., REPL, debugger, code formatter, ...)

  - Not actually part of the language

These are 5 separate issues
  - In pratice, all are essential for good programmers
  - Many people confuse them, but shouldn't
