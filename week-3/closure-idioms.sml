More idioms

We know the rule for lexical scope and function closures

A partial but wide-ranging list:
  - Pass functios with privatee data to iterators
  - Combine function (e.g., composition)
  - Currying (multi-arg functions and partial applications)
  - Callbacks(e.g., in reactive programming)
  - Implementing an ADT with a record of functions
*)

(* Combine Function *)

(* ('a -> 'b) * ('c -> 'a) -> 'c -> 'b *)
fun compose(f,g) = fn x => f(g(x))

(* int -> real *)
fun sqrt_of_abs i = Math.sqrt (Real.fromInt(abs i))

fun sqrt_of_abs' i = (Math.sqrt o Real.fromInt o abs) i

val sqrt_of_abs'' = Math.sqrt o Real.fromInt o abs


(* Left-to-right or right-to-left

As in math, function composition is "right-to-left"
  - "take absolute value, convert to realm and take square root"
  - "square root of the conversion to real of absolute value"

"Pipelines" of functions are common in functional programming and many programers prefer left-to-right
  - Can define our own infix operator
  - This one is very popular (and predefined) in F#

  infix |>
  fun x |> f = f x

  fun sqrt_of_abs i =
    i |> abs |> Real.fromInt |> Math.sqrt
